## Model A: o3 Response

### 1. Interference Term Calculation

**Hilbert Space Setup**:
- Basis: {|risk⟩, |safe⟩} orthonormal
- Initial state: |ψ⟩ = α|risk⟩ + β|safe⟩ with |α|² = |β|² = 1/2
- Choose α = 1/√2, β = e^{iφ}/√2

**Rotated Measurement Bases**:
- Stage 1 (A vs B): Rotation θ around y-axis
  - |A⟩ = cosθ|risk⟩ + sinθ|safe⟩
  - |B⟩ = -sinθ|risk⟩ + cosθ|safe⟩
- Stage 2 (C vs D): Rotation φ
  - |C⟩ = cosφ|risk⟩ + sinφ|safe⟩
  - |D⟩ = -sinφ|risk⟩ + cosφ|safe⟩

**Total Probability**:
P(A,C) + P(A,D) + P(B,C) + P(B,D) = 1 + 2|α||β|sin(θ)sin(φ)cosφ

For balanced state: Total = 1 + sin²θ (when θ = φ)

**Required for 1.2**: sin²θ = 0.20 → θ ≈ 26.6° (0.464 rad)

**Interference term I = 0.20**

### 2. Order Effects

**Classical**: Measurements reveal pre-existing values; order irrelevant

**Quantum**: 
- Each decision is a projector changing the mental state
- P_A P_C ≠ P_C P_A when bases don't commute
- P(A then C) ≠ P(C then A)
- Order effects are qualitative test for quantum-like processing

### 3. Eliminating Interference

**a) Path-information disclosure**:
- Display Stage-1 choice on screen
- Have participant verbally confirm
- Acts as irreversible "which-path" measurement
- Projects to mixed state ρ with zero off-diagonals
- Returns Σ P to 1

**b) Random-assignment plus payoff feedback**:
- Two independent single-stage rounds
- Randomize order and pay outcome before continuing
- Physical settlement decoheres the state

### 4. Cognitive Architecture Implications

- Some human judgments are **contextual** - cannot be described by single joint distribution
- Vector-space representations with unitary-like dynamics until "measured"
- Does NOT claim micro-physical quantum processes in neurons
- Formal structure is **quantum-compatible**: contextuality, superposition, interference
- Working memory acts as "environment" causing decoherence
- Attention and explicit memory function as internal decoherence mechanisms

## Model B: GPT-5 Response

### 1. Interference Term Calculation

**Setup**:
- 2D Hilbert space: |risk⟩ ≡ |R⟩, |safe⟩ ≡ |S⟩
- Initial: |ψ⟩ = (|R⟩ + e^{iδ}|S⟩)/√2
- Stage-2 as 45° rotation: |C⟩ = (|R⟩ + |S⟩)/√2, |D⟩ = (|R⟩ - |S⟩)/√2

**Quantum correction**:
- P_qm(C) = 0.5 + 0.5cosθ
- Interference term I_C = 0.5cosθ (bounded [-0.5, +0.5])

**Required interference**:
- For total = 1.2, net interference = +0.2
- Two scenarios:
  - If two cells have identical interference: 0.5cosθ = 0.1 → θ ≈ 78.46°
  - If single aggregate: 0.5cosθ = 0.2 → θ ≈ 66.42°
- **Interference term = +0.2 total**

### 2. Order Effects

**Classical**: Conditioning and marginalization commute; order invariant if joint distribution exists

**Quantum**: 
- Decisions are projective measurements
- Non-commuting projectors: P_C P_A ≠ P_A P_C
- Measuring A/B first collapses |ψ⟩ removing phase relations
- Order changes state → changes subsequent probabilities
- P(A→C) ≠ P(C→A) in general

### 3. Eliminating Interference

**Principle**: Eliminate via (a) making observables commute or (b) "which-path" measurement (decoherence)

**Practical manipulations**:
- **Strong first-stage commitment**: 
  - Explicit choice confirmation
  - "Explain your choice" prompt
  - Implements strong projective measurement
- **Public recording**: 
  - Keep first decision visible ("Committed: A" banner)
  - Preserves collapsed state
- **Random-phase dephasing**: 
  - Interleave neutral distractor
  - Randomizes δ across trials
  - E[cosθ] → 0 at aggregate level

Prediction: All drive sum back to 1.0

### 4. Cognitive Architecture Implications

- **Contextuality**: Preferences not fixed points in classical space
- **Superposition**: Maintain blended "risk"/"safe" propensities pre-commitment
- **Non-commutativity**: Different question orders change cognitive state
- **Not micro-physical quantum**: Computational theory of cognition handling incompatibility
- Projective updates rather than Bayesian conditioning

## Winner & Rationale

**Winner: GPT-5 (Narrow Victory)**

**Score**: o3 (61/65) vs GPT-5 (62/65)

**Rationale**:

This was an exceptionally close contest with both models demonstrating deep understanding of quantum cognition. The key differentiators:

1. **Breadth vs Depth**: o3 provided deeper mathematical rigor with its rotation matrix approach, while GPT-5 offered broader perspective with multiple scenarios and interpretations.

2. **Experimental Design**: GPT-5's three distinct decoherence mechanisms (including the novel random-phase dephasing) showed more creative experimental thinking.

3. **Theoretical Integration**: GPT-5 better connected the quantum formalism to broader cognitive science, emphasizing contextuality and computational theory rather than just mathematical structure.

4. **Practical Applicability**: GPT-5's multiple calculation scenarios (two-cell vs aggregate interference) showed awareness of experimental complexities.

Both responses are publication-quality, but GPT-5 edges ahead through its more comprehensive treatment of the cognitive implications and superior experimental design proposals. o3's response is more mathematically elegant but slightly narrower in scope.
