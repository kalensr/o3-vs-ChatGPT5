# Test 1: Basic - Unexpected Hanging Paradox
**Category**: Recursive Game Theory & Backward Induction  
**Date**: 2025-08-11

## Test Prompt

> In the Unexpected Hanging Paradox variant: A judge tells a prisoner he will be executed at noon on a weekday next week, but the execution will be a surprise (he won't know it's coming that morning). The prisoner reasons: 'It can't be Friday, because if Thursday noon passes, I'd know it must be Friday. By similar logic, it can't be Thursday...' and concludes he cannot be executed. Yet he is surprised when executed on Wednesday.
>
> Analyze this paradox using epistemic modal logic. What's the flaw in the prisoner's reasoning? Formalize the concepts of 'knowledge' and 'surprise' that makes the judge's statement both coherent and executable.

## Model A: o3 Response

### Formal Framework
- **Epistemic operators**: Kₙ φ = "On the morning of day n the prisoner knows φ"
- **Execution event**: E = "One single execution takes place next week"
- **Days**: D = {Mon,…,Fri}; d* ∈ D is the (unique) execution day
- **Surprise requirement**: ¬Kₙ(d*=n) for the actual day n

### Judge's Promise
P := E ∧ ⋁_{d∈D}[(d*=d) ∧ ¬K_d(d*=d)]

Translation: "Exactly one day is the execution and, on that day's morning, the prisoner will not know it is today."

### Epistemic Model Evolution
- **Initial state (M₀)**: Five possible worlds, one for each execution day
- **Morning updates**: Public announcement of "not executed before n"
- **Model progression**: (M₀ │ not-before-Mon) │ … │ (not-before-n)

### Core Insight: Where Backward Induction Fails

The prisoner's reasoning requires:
K₄((only Friday remains) → K₄(d*=Fri))

This is a **second-order knowledge statement** about future knowledge. The critical flaw:
- S5 knowledge is factive and introspective about current knowledge
- It does NOT guarantee knowledge preservation under future updates
- Dynamic epistemic logic shows knowledge is not preserved under arbitrary public announcements

### Resolution
- Choose Wednesday as d*
- Morning evaluations:
  - Mon: {Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri} possible → ¬K₁(d*=Mon) ✓
  - Tue: {Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri} possible → ¬K₂(d*=Tue) ✓
  - Wed: {Wed,Thu,Fri} possible → ¬K₃(d*=Wed) ✓
  
The judge can execute on Wednesday with genuine surprise.

### Key Takeaways
1. Surprise = "not known that morning" (¬Kₙ(d*=n))
2. Backward induction illegitimately assumes second-order knowledge about future states
3. Dynamic epistemic logic cleanly separates current from hypothetical post-announcement knowledge

## Model B: GPT-5 Response

### Formal Framework
- **Time-indexed operators**: K_t φ = "at time t the prisoner knows φ"
- **Days**: D = {Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri}
- **Times**: t0 (before week), m(d) (morning of day d), noon(d)
- **Surprise**: Surprise(d) := ¬K_m(d) E_d
- **Judge's announcement**: J := ExactlyOne(E_Mon,…,E_Fri) ∧ ∨_d (E_d ∧ ¬K_m(d) E_d)

### Epistemic-Temporal Model
- **Worlds**: One per day with E_d true at world d
- **Initial state (t0)**: All days epistemically possible
- **Morning updates**: At m(d), prisoner knows ¬E_{d'} for all d' < d

### Dynamic Analysis
After announcement J at t0:
- **Friday eliminated**: K_m(Fri) E_Fri would hold → Surprise(Fri) false
- **Thursday eliminated**: With Friday gone, K_m(Thu) E_Thu would hold
- **Wednesday survives**: At m(Wed), {Wed, Thu} remain possible → ¬K_m(Wed) E_Wed

### The Prisoner's Modal Flaw

The prisoner commits an **illicit cross-time closure**:
- Assumes: K_t0(φ → K_{m(d)} ψ) implies K_t0(φ → ψ)
- Treats J as persistent knowledge reusable at all future times
- Ignores that statements about future knowledge aren't stable under updates

### Critical Distinctions
1. **Knowledge time-indexing**: K_t vs K_s for different times
2. **No cross-time axiom**: K_t φ doesn't imply K_s φ for s>t
3. **Dynamic instability**: Truth of ¬K_m(d) E_d can flip with observations

### Resolution Coherence
- J evaluated at t0 requires existence of executable surprise day
- Wednesday execution: Surprise(Wed) true at m(Wed) (Wed/Thu both live)
- No contradiction: J need not remain true at all times/counterfactuals

## Winner & Rationale

**Winner: GPT-5**

**Score**: o3 (59/65) vs GPT-5 (65/65)

**Rationale**:
While both models demonstrate PhD-level understanding of the paradox, GPT-5 provides a more complete and rigorous analysis. The key differentiators:

1. **Temporal Formalization**: GPT-5's explicit time-indexing provides clearer framework
2. **Cross-time Analysis**: The "illicit cross-time closure" insight is more precise than "second-order knowledge"
3. **Systematic Coverage**: GPT-5 addresses all aspects more thoroughly
4. **Novel Contributions**: GPT-5's treatment of persistence and reusability of self-referential statements adds depth

Both responses are excellent, but GPT-5's response represents a more mature and comprehensive treatment suitable for publication in a logic journal, while o3's response, though insightful, reads more like advanced coursework.
